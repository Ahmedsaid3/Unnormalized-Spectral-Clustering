# Unnormalized Spectral Clustering on ITU Road Network: Implementation and Comparison with Direct K-Means
A from-scratch implementation of the unnormalized spectral clustering algorithm was performed on the Istanbul Technical University road network graph. The construction of the graph, computation of the Laplacian, inverse power method for eigenvectors, clustering via K-Means on spectral embedding and on geographic coordinates, and modularity evaluation are described. Experiments for cluster counts k = 6, 9, 12, 15 compare spectral embedding + K-Means against direct K-Means on 2D node coordinates. Spectral clustering consistently yields higher modularity and more coherent communities, especially as k increases. Eight illustrative figures visualize the outcomes.
